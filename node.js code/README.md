# Node.js / Express.js Implementation

This branch is used to implement:
1. Node.js, which is designed to build scalable network applications. 
2. Express.js, which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a 
robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid 
development of Node based Web applications.

The code included in this branch will be used to make a Node.js application that takes an array
or vector of strings and outputs them to the front end of our website.
